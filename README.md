#Lerp2API#

Our API for Unity. It contains several features to make easier your coding in this Engine.

Documentation (not available yet)
[https://github.com/Lerp2Dev/Lerp2API/wiki](Wiki) ... Please review this!!

## Next features ##

The ability of save every scene in Unity.

Maybe I will add CS-Script Asset (it's to load .cs files at runtime), yep, Unity modding with my API is coming stronger and stronger. (Serializers do a good job, but they need something more :P).

I'm searching some way to avoid Floating Point precision errors, I founded some time ago, Floating Origin, but I am not sure about it (and it's compatibility in Multiplayer).

An installer for my API (this will use to install the API in your projects in a easy way).

QuixelEngine to work with Marching Cubes in my API (I'm working in a Terrain System, but this doesn't use voxels, I will make an expensive version that use Voxels, adn it will use an refined version of it). I doesn't have an chunk system for example!

An interactive menu to Editor Input Manager in the game.

A Minimap Utility for the game.

AForge.NET (something to detect shapes in images) I will try to do something interesting with it.

Generate Readme Console Commands parts from Editor.

A permission system for multiplayer.

Listen to externally projects that are compiled and imported automattically after their edit.

A lot of new parts of code/libraries from outside:

- All the free assets that Ikillnukes has prepared to upload
- Some procedural generators
- Asset unpacker
- CsScript
- QuixelEngine
- Utymap / ActionStreetMaps
- Etc etc...

We will do some free versions of some paid assets:

- Ai4Unity

Minimap for this.

Shaders for the API.

Object demo from my other assets.

Selectable part of compilation due to the bigger coming content.

Listen to other Projects path.

Shooter api (Novashot one).

Server utility (apart dll).

Login utility (another dll).

Minigame utility (another dll)

## In the next version ##

Maybe, I will work in some information for the XML and maybe in a documentation page, the manual will come later.

Moar commands for the Console.

Multiple key handlings for Lerped Key Action Utility.

Better support for command modding (new method finder system w/ reflection)

Some tasks I didn't fixed in this version:

- Add the posibility of undone something in a text field
- Copy text from the chat [HARD TASK]
- Some bugs with the formatting codes (If you put several fomatting codes in the same line the chat goes crazy, and some underline functions are still unfinished)
- Some parts of the code is commented with a starting sentence "I have to", this is the most important things I didn't done
- Escape formatting codes with \&...
- Remove unnecesary stackstrace if desired (Reduced stacktrace option)
- Put errors from cmd console into Unity [HARD OR IMPOSSIBLE TASK DUE TO UNITY INCAPACITY]
