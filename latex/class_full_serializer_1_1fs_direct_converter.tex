The direct converter is similar to a regular converter, except that it targets specifically only one type. This means that it can be used without performance impact when discovering converters. It is strongly recommended that you derive from \hyperlink{class_full_serializer_1_1fs_direct_converter}{fs\+Direct\+Converter}\{T\+Model\}.

\subsection{Detailed Description}
The direct converter is similar to a regular converter, except that it targets specifically only one type. This means that it can be used without performance impact when discovering converters. It is strongly recommended that you derive from \hyperlink{class_full_serializer_1_1fs_direct_converter}{fs\+Direct\+Converter}\{T\+Model\}. 

Due to the way that direct converters operate, inheritance is {\itshape not} supported. Direct converters will only be used with the exact Model\+Type object.
